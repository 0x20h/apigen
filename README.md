# APIGen

We have taken the original [David Grudl's](https://github.com/dg) [APIGen](https://github.com/nette/apigen) library and continuously modify it to suit our needs.

All changes can be found in separate branches. Each branch is based on the original library master and all changes are being sent via pull requests to the upstream.

Changes from [Jaroslav Hansl√≠k's](https://github.com/kukulich) [fork](https://github.com/kukulich/apigen) are also incorporated - in branches prefixed "kukulich".

Being under rapid development, there are no "stable releases". Well, in fact... there are no "releases" at all :) You can always find the latest version in the master branch.
